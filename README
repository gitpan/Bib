             Text::Bib -- a Perl5 module for parsing .bib files


DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This is Text::Bib::, a Perl5 module for parsing refer/grefer-style
   .bib files.
  
   For more details, consult the POD documentation in Bib.pm, or
   go right to the ./docs directory: the HTML and man pages have been 
   pre-made for you.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
   Perl 5.001 or later.  It might work with earlier Perl5's, but I 
   couldn't verify it, so I decided not to risk it.
   
INSTALLATION
------------
   Unfortunately, I couldn;t figure out how to have Makefile.PL be
   happy when there aren't .o files to be made.  So the installation is
   a little manual right now...

   1.  Locate your site's Perl library.  This might be /usr/lib/perl,
       /usr/local/lib/perl, etc.

   2.  Make the appropriate entry in the Makefile.

   3.  Do the following:

      make install
      make sample


TESTING
-------
   The ./sample directory holds some basic sample scripts.
